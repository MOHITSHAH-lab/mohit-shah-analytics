Inventory Management Analytics Framework

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing an end-to-end Inventory Management Analytics Framework to help organizations:

- Reduce overstock and understock situations
- Minimize revenue loss due to stockouts
- Improve supplier and distributor performance
- Optimize working capital and overall revenue

The solution is filter-driven, KPI-backed, and designed for decision-makers, not just reporting.

🎯 Business Problems Solved
- Excess capital locked in slow-moving or dead stock
- Revenue loss due to frequent stockouts
- Poor visibility into supplier and distributor performance
- Inefficient replenishment and reorder planning
- Lack of prioritization for high-impact SKUs

---

🧠 Analytical Approach
- Focused on the Pareto principle (20% SKUs driving 80% revenue)
- Combines demand, supply, and operational performance metrics
- Uses variability (SD, CV) to identify unstable and risky SKUs
- Aligns inventory decisions with revenue and customer impact

---

📊 Key Outcomes
- Identified dead stock and high holding-cost items
- Quantified missed sales due to stockouts
- Enabled reorder planning using EOQ & Reorder Point logic
- Highlighted suppliers and distributors needing performance improvement
